# Visualization of Convolutional Neural Network Layer Architecture and Explainability

This project is dedicated to enhancing the interpretability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using state-of-the-art techniques like Grad-CAM, LIME, and SHAP. By visualizing model predictions and evaluating performance with various optimizers, this project aims to demystify the decision-making process of deep learning models.

## Visualizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) Repository

Welcome to our comprehensive toolkit for visualizing and interpreting Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This repository features a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to help you understand and analyze how CNNs process images.

### Dataset
The repository includes images of animals, such as cats and dogs, intended for both training and testing purposes in machine learning models.

### CNN Visualization
Explore a variety of techniques to visualize and understand how CNNs extract and process features from images.

### DenseNet Visualization
Gain insights into DenseNet models, focusing on their dense connectivity which enhances information flow and gradient propagation.

### Grad-CAM Visualization (`grad_cam_visualization.ipynb`)
This notebook guides you through the Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) technique. Create heatmaps that highlight crucial regions in your images, directly influencing your model's predictions. Compatible with any pre-trained CNN model, this notebook utilizes a range of optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSProp, AdaGrad, Adadelta) and activation functions (Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, Leaky ReLU, Softmax).

### LIME Visualization (`Lime_visualization.ipynb`)
Unveil the mystery behind individual CNN predictions with LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations). This notebook enables you to explain predictions by identifying pivotal regions in your input data. Supporting various optimizers and activation functions, it works seamlessly with any pre-trained CNN model.

### SHAP Visualization (`Shap_visualization.ipynb`)
Decode your CNN predictions with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). This notebook provides an in-depth analysis of how different input features contribute to your model's output. Compatible with any pre-trained CNN model, it utilizes various optimizers and activation functions to generate insightful visualizations.
